In the recent snapshots Mojang added many new uses for copper in the form of new items, blocks and armor. Unfortunately, the textures for many of them turned out to be either unfinished or straight up copied from blocks made of iron. This pack aims to fix that!

Many new copper-related features, such as copper bars, lanterns and armor, get a complete redesign. In addition, telling waxed and unwaxed items apart becomes much easier, while lightning rods struck by lightning get a unique glowing texture instead of plain white. All these changes are supposed to make working with copper blocks and items a much more pleasant experience
